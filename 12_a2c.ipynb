    "\n",
    "One of the weak points of the PG method is that the gradient scales $Q(s, a)$ may experience quite significant variance* which does not help the training at all. We fixed this issue by introducing a fixed *baseline* value (e.g. mean reward) that was subtracted from the gradient scales Q.\n",

    "\\* Recall formal defintion: $\\mathbb{V}[X] = \\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mathbb{E}[X])^2]$\n",

    "Let's illustrate this problem and solution on simple example:\n",
    "* Assume there are three actions with $Q_1$, $Q_2$ some small positive values and $Q_3$ being large negative\n",
    "* In this case there will be small positive gradient towards fist two actions and large negative one repelling the policy from the third one\n",
    "* Now imagine $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ were large positive values instead. Then $Q_3$ would become small but positive value. The gradient would still push the policy towards fist two actions but it would direct the gradient towards the trird one a bit as well (instead of pushing it away from it)!\n",

    "Now it's a bit more clear why subtracting a constant value that we called the *baseline* helps."
