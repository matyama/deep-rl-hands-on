    "## Values and Policy\n",
    "Contrary to the value iteration methods (Q-Learning) which try to estimate the state values (state-action values), the *policy gradient* technique focus directly on the policy $\\pi(s)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Direct policy modeling has several advantages:\n",
    "* From certain point of view, we don't care that much about the expected discounted rewards but rather the decision/action $\\pi(s)$ to take in each state $s$\n",
    "* As we saw earlier with the *Categorical DQN*, learning a distribution helps to better capture the underlying MDP (especially in stochastic environments)\n",
    "* It becomes quite a hard to determine the best action to take when the action space is large or even continuous. The DQN model of $Q(s, a)$ is highly non-linear and the optimization problem $a^* = argmax_a Q(s, a)$ can be hard to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the value iteration case our DQN parametrized the state-action values as $DQN(s) \\to Q_\\mathbf{w}(s, \\cdot)$. Similarly, we will represent the policy as a probability distribution over actions $\\pi_\\mathbf{w}(s)$ parametrized by the NN.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Modelling the output as action (class) probabilities is a typical technique in classification tasks that gives us a smooth representation (intuitively, changing NN weights $\\mathbf{w}$ a bit changes $\\pi$ a bit as well - compared to the case with discrete action labels which would change in steps).*"

This corresponds to having $Q(s, a) = 1$ for the good transitions and $Q(s, a) = 0$ otherwise.

    "First drawback of REINFORCE and PG methods in general is that it is way **less sample efficient**. In order to estimate Q values as well as possible we need quite a lot of interations with the environment from full episodes. Moreover, the length of the episodes we must play only inreases in complex environments (e.g. episodes in Atari Pong might have thousands of steps).\n",

    "In the DQN scenario we used our own $Q(s, a)$ to estimate $V(s)$ in the one-step Bellman update: $Q(s, a) = r_a + \\gamma V(s')$. But in PG we don't have Q values - these are approximated from episodes completed in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two approaches dealing with this issue:\n",
    "* We use the NN to estimate $V(s)$ as well as action logits and use these state values to obtain Qs. This approach implements the *actor-critic method* which will be described later.\n",
