    "## Values and Policy\n",
    "Contrary to the value iteration methods (Q-Learning) which try to estimate the state values (state-action values), the *policy gradient* technique focus directly on the policy $\\pi(s)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Direct policy modeling has several advantages:\n",
    "* From certain point of view, we don't care that much about the expected discounted rewards but rather the decision/action $\\pi(s)$ to take in each state $s$\n",
    "* As we saw earlier with the *Categorical DQN*, learning a distribution helps to better capture the underlying MDP (especially in stochastic environments)\n",
    "* It becomes quite a hard to determine the best action to take when the action space is large or even continuous. The DQN model of $Q(s, a)$ is highly non-linear and the optimization problem $a^* = argmax_a Q(s, a)$ can be hard to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the value iteration case our DQN parametrized the state-action values as $DQN(s) \\to Q_\\mathbf{w}(s, \\cdot)$. Similarly, we will represent the policy as a probability distribution over actions $\\pi_\\mathbf{w}(s)$ parametrized by the NN.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Modelling the output as action (class) probabilities is a typical technique in classification tasks that gives us a smooth representation (intuitively, changing NN weights $\\mathbf{w}$ a bit changes $\\pi$ a bit as well - compared to the case with discrete action labels which would change in steps).*"

    "*Policy Gradient* methods are closely related to the *Cross-Entropy Method* introduced earlier.

    "\n",
    "Recall that in the *Cross-Entropy Method* we sampled the environment for few episodes and trained only on transitions from the above-average ones. This corresponds to having $Q(s, a) = 1$ for the good transitions and $Q(s, a) = 0$ otherwise. In general, policy gradient methods differ in the way how $Q$ values are treated but in any case we want to use $Q(s, a) \\in [0, 1]$:\n",

    "## The REINFORCE method\n",
    "The outline of the *REINFORCE* methods is the following:\n",
    "1. Initialize NN weights randomly\n",
    "1. Play $N$ full episode and collect experiences $(s, a, r, s')$\n",
    "1. Compute actual $Q$ values for every played episode $k$ and step $t$: $Q_{k, t} = \\sum_{i=0}^t \\gamma^t r_t$\n",
    "1. Compute the loss for all transitions: $\\mathcal{L} = - \\sum_{k, t} Q_{k, t} \\log(\\pi(s_{k, t}, a_{k, t}))$\n",
    "1. Do one SGD step by minimizing the loss and update NN weights\n",
    "1. Repeat from step 2. until convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties of the REINFORCE method:\n",
    "* We **don't need an explicit exploration policy** because we explore automatically using the policy our NN outputs.\n",
    "* **On-policy** method, therefore no ER buffer is needed because we can't train on the data from old policies. On the other hand, value methods typically need less interations with the environment.\n",
    "* We train on actual Q values and not estimated ones so we **don't need a target NN** to break experience correlations either."

    "#### Complete episodes\n",
    "First drawback of REINFORCE and PG methods in general is that it is way **less sample efficient**. In order to estimate Q values as well as possible we need quite a lot of interations with the environment from full episodes. Moreover, the length of the episodes we must play only inreases in complex environments (e.g. episodes in Atari Pong might have thousands of steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the DQN scenario we used our own $Q(s, a)$ to estimate $V(s)$ in the one-step Bellman update: $Q(s, a) = r_a + \\gamma V(s')$. But in PG we don't have Q values - these are approximated from episodes completed in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two approaches dealing with this issue:\n",
    "* We use the NN to estimate $V(s)$ as well as action logits and use these state values to obtain Qs. This approach implements the *actor-critic method* which will be described later.\n",
    "* The other way is to unroll the Bellman Eq. N steps ahead which will implicitly exploit the fact that the future value contribution is discounted by $\\gamma < 1$."

    "Even though we can get rid of exploration strategies (e.g. epsilon-greedy) because we can sample from current policy, the agent can still converge to a sub-optimal policy. Fortunately, we can benefit from the fact that we have represented the policy as a probability distribution and add an *entropy bonus* to the loss funciton.\n",

    "#### Correlation between samples\n",
    "As mentioned before, we cannot use an experience replay buffer as we did in DQN to break correlations between experiences from one episode because PG is an *on-policy* method. If we did use old experiences, we'd compute gradient of an old policy, not the current one.\n",

    "A typical trick to solve this problem for the PG methods is to sample from multiple environments (independent but the same) at once. This will give us an i.i.d. set of experiences for the SGD step (or close enough)."
